# BPGA-related R-scripts

## Purpose of the repository
This repository stores a bunch of scripts (eg. R-scripts) that can be integrated to the analysis performed by BPGA (Bacterial Pan Genome Analysis tool, [Chaudhari et al.]( https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24373)). The scripts allow the user to repeat BPGA-analysis (in order to produce a custom output) or to perform downstream steps.

## Description
Each script is paired with a template output.

## Stored scripts
  - **1-pan-core_plot**: Produce a custom Pan/Core plot.
  - **2-COG-distribution_plot**: Plot the distribution of the COG categories in the core-, accessory- and unique-genome.
